A pretty simple guessing game that takes an input from the user and gives feedback on how well they did against the the random number generated between 1 and 100 both inclusive. 
The game is over once the user correctly guesses the number. 
!!The code itself is in the src/main.rs file while the dependencies are in the cargo.toml file.
